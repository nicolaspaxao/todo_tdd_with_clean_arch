  Test Driven Development is a simple approche to develop more careful your business rules, create some functionality is necessary
  ensure that shall handle sucess, errors and exceptions. Since you have a notion the intention of your code, o must write a simple test, expectating the success,
  but it must have failed, after that you'll write the frst happy return, after that, come with a cenarious when this method can fail. Thus, rewrite your code to handle possibles exceptions and finally get back to the their tests and ensure again that is handling correctly. Nevertheless, you wrote a good feature. It's the TDD.
